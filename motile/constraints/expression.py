    """Enforce selection of nodes/edges based on an expression.

    The expression string is evaluated with the node/edge dict as a namespace.

    This is a powerful general constraint that allows you to select nodes/edges based on
    any combination of node/edge attributes. The `expression` string is evaluated for
    each node/edge (assuming eval_nodes/eval_edges is True) using the actual node object
    as a namespace to populate any variables names used in the provided expression. If
    the expression evaluates to True, the node/edge is selected; otherwise, it is
    excluded.

    This takes advantaged of python's `eval` function, like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        my_expression = "some_attribute == True"
        eval(my_expression, None, {"some_attribute": True})  # returns True (select)
        eval(my_expression, None, {"some_attribute": False})  # returns False (exclude)
        eval(my_expression, None, {})  # raises NameError (do nothing)

    Args:
        expression:
            An expression to evaluate for each node/edge. The expression must
            evaluate to a boolean value. The expression can use any names of
            node/edge attributes as variables.
        eval_nodes:
            Whether to evaluate the expression for nodes. By default, True.
        eval_edges:
            Whether to evaluate the expression for edges. By default, True.

    Example:
        If the nodes of a graph are:

        >>> cells = [
        ...     {"id": 0, "t": 0, "color": "red", "score": 1.0},
        ...     {"id": 1, "t": 0, "color": "green", "score": 1.0},
        ...     {"id": 2, "t": 1, "color": "blue", "score": 1.0},
        ... ]

        Then the following constraint will select node 0:

        >>> expr = "t == 0 and color != 'green'"
        >>> solver.add_constraints(ExpressionConstraint(expr))
