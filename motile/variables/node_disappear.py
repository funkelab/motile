    r"""Binary variable to indicate whether a node disappears.

    This variable indicates whether the node is the end of a track (i.e., the node is
    selected and has no selected outgoing edges).

    This variable is coupled to the node and edge selection variables through
    the following linear constraints:

    .. math::
        |\\text{out_edges}(v)|\cdot x_v - &\sum_{e \in \\text{out_edges}(v)} x_e
        - d_v &\leq&\;\; |\\text{out_edges}(v)| - 1

        |\\text{out_edges}(v)|\cdot x_v - &\sum_{e \in \\text{out_edges}(v)} x_e
        - d_v\cdot |\\text{out_edges}(v)| &\geq&\;\; 0

    where :math:`x_v` and :math:`x_e` are selection indicators for node
    :math:`v` and edge :math:`e`, and :math:`d_v` is the disappear indicator for
    node :math:`v`.
